The *simpubs* tech team (ie [jzedward]) have been working on how to easily edit and deploy new blog posts to this site. It is hosted on [x10], a free (as in beer) service, which only has ftp available to load content.  

However, the brilliant [ftp deploy] provides a way to automagically update from a [github] repository (aka repo) to ftp. The code below is added as a *github action* to [blog.simpubs.org] (which has the entire site and a Docker container script to build it) - and the action loads directly to [x10].

**Note:** the code below has `dry-run` set to `true` so will only check differences, not load
