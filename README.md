# blog.simpubs.org
[www.simpubs.org] is **the** archive of classic wargames.  
[blog.simpubs.org] offers some info and background on *simpubs* content, including some of the tech that makes *simpubs* tick, including [nextcloud].  
[grav] is the content management system (CMS) for [blog.simpubs.org], a flat-file CMS with great flexibility, running on free [x10hosting].  

This repo is the master for [blog.simpubs.org], storing and managing blog content here on [github].  The repo contains a docker-compose and dockerfile to build an apache/php web server to host grav, and includes all the grav files to run a docker copy of the site as a local DEV environment, before deployment to PROD on [x10hosting].  

The site content (in user/pages) is published to using the (brilliant) FTP Deploy action.
